      <h2>What is Lemme Help?</h2>
     <p>Helping Hands is a non-profit organization dedicated to serving those most at-risk to COVID-19:
      senior citizens, the immune compromised, and people with pre-existing medical conditions which
      put them at additional risk.</br>
      Our community volunteers and delivery partners deliver groceries, medicine, and other necessary
      supplies to empower everyone to stay healthy and be as responsible as they can be.</br></br>
